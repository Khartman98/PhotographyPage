		<p>It all started back in middle school. Most kids were mainly interested in video games while I on the other hand enjoyed going outside after school and taking pictures of everything. Too me at the time I thought photos were amazing coming off my small blackberry phone. But that wasnt the case for long. In 2012 is when my dreams reallt started to come true. My mother gave me Canon Rebel T3. My first official perfessional photography camera. It all progressed from there. I began to take photography classes in highscool and even courses online outside of school. I then began to do photos for the school newspaper, then it lead to bookings with family members and friends and brought me all the way up to where I am today. I enjoy traveling and capturing the breathless moments or capturing the breathless moments for other people.</p></article>
